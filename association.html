		<p>In 2025, we founded the non-profit association WOMEN AND ALLIES IN CRYPTOGRAPHY (WINC) under the French law of 1st July 1901
		as confirmed <a href="https://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/pages/associations-detail-annonce/?q.id=id:202500210779">[here]</a>.</p>
		The goal of this non-profit association is, among other things, to promote diversity and integrate more women into the scientific community around cryptography, provide an inclusive space for discussion and growth, offer mentorship and role models, as well as actively participate in the organization
of the cryptography research community.</p>

  <h3>Birds of a Feather Event during <a href="https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2024/" target="_blank">Eurocrypt 2024</a> in Zürich, May 2024</h3>
  <h4>Event Description</h4>
  <p>
    During the “Women & Allies in Cryptography Discussions", we aim to provide a space that brings together different groups to discuss different topics related to <i style="color:purple; font-weight:500;">diversity in cryptography</i>. Each group gathers around a table that will be guided by a senior researcher, allowing participants to discuss and collaboratively brainstorm different ideas on a shared board. The event will conclude with each table presenting key discussion points and potential strategies for improving diversity in our community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of this event is threefold:
  </p>

  <ol start=1>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Gather</strong> people who advocate for improving the diversity in the cryptography community,</li>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Listen</strong> to the perspectives from those who suffer from the lack of diversity in our community,</li>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Brainstorm</strong> ideas on how to address the raised issues as a first step for a concrete plan of action.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    One of the motivations of this event is extending the activities of the Women in Cryptography (WinC) community to in-person spaces.
  </p>
  <h4>Discussion topics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>From visas to breastfeeding: how to organize an inclusive conference. Moderated by Rachel Player and Diego Aranha. </li>
