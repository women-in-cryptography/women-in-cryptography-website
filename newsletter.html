</p>

<p><i>ðŸ“£ We are looking for organizers for an event at Asiacrypt 24!</i>

Asiacryptâ€™ 24 notifications are out. We hope your paper(s) got accepted and sympathize if they didnâ€™t! ðŸ’œ
If you, Winc or ally, are planning on attending Asiacryptâ€™ 24 and would like to help organize a WinC event, reach out!

The event does not have to be a workshop but can take any form you would like (lunch, coffee break, panel,...?), we just believe that it is important to have a WinC presence at Asiacrypt too. We already have a team working on it, but they can really use any extra help!
You can contact us using the information at the end of the newsletter or by expressing your interest on the #asiacrypt channel on Discord.
If you are keen on organizing WinC events at upcoming conferences too, feel free to contact us as well.

Youâ€™ve been reading this newsletter and thought about a couple things that could have been done better? Think no further! We are looking for volunteer(s) to help us write it.
Whether you are a Winc or an ally, we are looking for someone to help write these short newsletter every couple of months to inform the community about our activities.

<p><i>ðŸŒŽ WinC at Cryptoâ€™24:</i>

After a successful first edition at Eurocryptâ€™24 in the Women & Allies in Cryptography discussions, we had another workshop at Cryptoâ€™24. Despite the beautiful weather competing with us on Tuesday afternoon, we had an attendance of about 40 people divided in three discussion groups centered around the following themes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizing an inclusive conference: visibility and code of conduct</li>
  <li>Low representation, high demand: the consequences of belonging to a minority</li>
  <li>Allyship: from belief to actions</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can find a video of the discussionsâ€™ summary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBzuLYPoKI" target="_blank">here</a>.
We had an overwhelming participation of the youngest members of our community, and while their enthusiasm and dedication is heartwarming, we would greatly appreciate the additional support of senior members for future events.
</p>

<p><i>ðŸŒŽ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion event at CCSâ€™24:</i>

There is an exciting DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) workshop organized at CCS this year, independently of WinC. Make sure to register if you are attending CCS!
