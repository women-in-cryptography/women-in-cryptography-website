  <h2>Second Edition of WinC Coffee Breaks January/February 2024</h2>
  <p>We are organizing our next edition of one-to-one coffee breaks of around 30 minutes among the Women in Crypto community. The coffee-break is planned for January/February 2024
 <br>
 <p>
The idea is that you sign up with your name, e-mail, affiliation, time zone, research topic and seniority level.
We further ask you to let us know what you would like to get out of this coffee break.
Depending on the answers we receive, we will find for every participant a match.
We let you then organize your meetings on your own, whereas we encourage meetings in one of our cozy discord rooms.
